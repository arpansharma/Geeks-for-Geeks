# Reverse First K elements of Queue (Function Problem)
## Difficulty Level: Easy

Given an integer k and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first k elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

    enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue
    dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue
    size(( : Returns number of elements in queue.
    front() : Finds front item.

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of 2 integers, N and K, denoting number of elements and number of elements to be reversed respectively. Second line of every test case consists of elements of array.

Output:
Single line output, print the modified queue.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=1000
1<=K<=N
